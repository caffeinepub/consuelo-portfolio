  "summary": "No explicit requirements/acceptance criteria were provided beyond the title’s implied logo/profile-photo replacement. The diff does change the hero profile image, but it also introduces broader styling/theme changes that were not requested and conflict with the stated non-goal of not changing section content beyond the logo swap.",

      "description": "Broad redesign of global styling to a “vibrant psychedelic” theme (color palette, backgrounds, typography animations) beyond a simple profile-photo/logo replacement.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest non-goal indicates no changes beyond the requested logo swap; the diff summary shows extensive global CSS/theme changes unrelated to swapping the profile photo.",
