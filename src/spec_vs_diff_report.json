  "summary": "REQ-15 cannot be fully verified from the provided diff excerpt: App.tsx is truncated before the Contact section/button implementation. The diff also includes additional styling/theme changes (index.css and tailwind.config.js) that were not requested for this frontend-only link update.",

      "requirement": "Update the “Contact Me” button in the Contact section (frontend/src/App.tsx) to open the Gmail web compose page addressed to randombookcreator@gmail.com using a Gmail compose URL (not a mailto link), opening in a new tab with rel=\"noopener noreferrer\", while keeping the label and styling consistent.",
      "reason": "The only code shown from frontend/src/App.tsx is truncated before the Contact section; the actual Contact Me button/link markup (href/target/rel/label) is not present in the excerpt, so the acceptance criteria cannot be confirmed from the diff evidence alone.",
